            <p>
              I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science at San
              Francisco State University. I was first fascinated by how oneâ€™s
              writing (coding languages) can take shape and for people to use
              them in daily life and now I am passionate about learning
              full-stack development. In my free time, I enjoy photography and
              listening to music. My goal is to be a great full-stack developer
              and use my skills to support women and the LGBTQ community into
              STEM fields.
