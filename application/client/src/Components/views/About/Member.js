        "I am a senior at San Francisco State finishing my final semester before I graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I wrote my first scrap of code in visual basic in a forward aid station in Afhganistan to help manage medication inventory and reduce the workload for my squad. Since then I have gained ever deeper appreciation for what a powerful force multiplier the right software can be. In my free time I enjoy brewing beer and painting.",

      bio: "I am a senior student majoring in Computer Science at San Francisco State University. I was first fascinated by how oneâ€™s writing (coding languages) can take shape and for people to use them in daily life and now I am passionate about learning full-stack development. In my free time, I enjoy photography and listening to music. My goal is to be a great full-stack developer and use my skills to support women and the LGBTQ community into STEM fields.",

After separating from the military, I became a full-time student at San Francisco State University where I'm currently studying computer science. I have a passion for software development and solving real-world problems with technology. When I'm not coding however, you can find me pursuing my other interests: art, music, fitness, sports, sustainable living, and science to name a few. I strive for self-improvement, and fully embrace lifelong learning! Stay kind, love life, and be well!",
