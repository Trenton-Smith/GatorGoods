 * File name: Routes.js
 * Purpose: This is where we have all the routes and components connected for our program.
 *          It is also connected to Auth.js which controls who can and who can't access
 *          the routes based on authentication from Auth.js.
 *          If the component is set it to null - Anyone can access the component,
 *                                        true - Only logged in user has access,
 *                                        false - Logged in user has NO access.
