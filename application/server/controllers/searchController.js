/**
 * File name: searchController.js
 * Purpose: This is where we house all the mysql queries related to populating our app with data from the db. Because we
 *          are using multiple tables connected by foreign keys, we need to use INNER JOIN to be able to pull columns
 *          from each. In 2. we set LIMIT to 4 because we are sampling listings for the home view. For each, we ensure
 *          visible="1" because initially listings are defaulted with visibility="0" in order to NOT pull from the db
 *          until admins have performed proper vetting, in which point they will either set to 1 and allow the post,
 *          keep at 0 until further inspection, or delete the listing's row altogether.
